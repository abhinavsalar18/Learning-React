Lifting state up 
- Need -> To make sync between children and parent component
- How -> Instead to creating local state variable for each child 
        we create a common state variable in parent and pass the functionality
        so that child can make changes in the state but eventually parent controlles
        the child componenet.
- Example -> In accordions we have to implement a functionality so that so expand of
             one accordion all other should collapse. The problem was when each child 
             havaing its own local state varible we can not do that because each posses
             individually functionality. To do this we have sync the components. Therefore 
             we created a state variable showIndex, setShowIndex inside parent and passed it 
             as a prop to each child. We have passed the setShowIndex as a function and attached
             index with it means each accordion wiil have its own copy of setShowIndex with it's index.
             Now on rendering if (showIndex === index) gets true then only the accordion wiil be visible.
             And hence at a time only one accordion will be visible and others will collapsed.
